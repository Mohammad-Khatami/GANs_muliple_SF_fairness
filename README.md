## Setting Up the Environment

### Using Conda (Optional)
If you prefer using Conda, you can create and activate a virtual environment with:

```bash
conda create --name my_env python=3.x
conda activate my_env
```

### Using pip
To set up the environment using `pip`, install the required dependencies from `pip_requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r pip_requirements.txt
```

## Running the Code
Ensure all necessary files are in the same directory before execution.

### Running with `execute.sh`
You can run the code using the provided shell script:

```bash
bash execute.sh
```

Modify the script values to suit your specifications.

## Notes
- Ensure that all required dependencies are installed before running the script.
- If using Conda, activate the environment before executing any scripts:
  ```bash
  conda activate my_env
  ```
- If using pip, verify that all required packages are installed as specified in `pip_requirements.txt`.
